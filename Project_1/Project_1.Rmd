# 1. Introduction

This analysis utilizes the **2020 Dog Breed Rankings** dataset sourced from the [American Kennel Club (AKC) Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/readme.md). The dataset includes rankings for various dog breeds based on their popularity and other characteristics.

### 1.1. Variables of Interest

The primary **outcome variable** in this analysis is **Trainability**, which indicates the breed's tendancy to be adaptable, with a higher number meaning more adaptable . Key **predictor variables** include:

-   **Energy Level** (numeric): This variable quantifies the amount of energy a breed typically displays.

-   **Openness to Strangers** (numeric): This variable indicates the degree to which a breed is friendly or reserved towards unfamiliar people.

-   **Coat Type** (categorical): This variable classifies breeds into categories based on their coat type (e.g. Double, Smooth).

The outcome variable, **Trainability**, reflects the adaptability of dog breeds, while the predictor variables—**Energy Level**, **Openness to Strangers**, and **Coat Type**— may provide insight into the factors that may influence this trait.

# 2. Outcome Variable Distribution

The chosen outcome variable, **Trainability**, is a logical choice given the context of the dataset, as it directly reflects the adaptability of different dog breeds. Understanding how this variable is distributed provides insight into the relative desirability of various breeds.

### 2.1. Distribution Description

The distribution of **Trainability** shows a right-skewed pattern, indicating that a majority of breeds have relatively high trainability, while fewer breeds occupy the lower trainability rankings. This suggests that most dog breeds are quite trainability, with only a select few being ranked at the bottom.

These statistics indicate that while the average **Trainability** level is usually on the higher end.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(dog_data, aes(x = Trainability)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#bf5700", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Dog Breed Trainability (2020)",
       x = "Trainability",
       y = "Frequency")
```

### 2.2. Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics for the outcome variable **Trainability** are as follows:

-   **Minimum:** 0

-   **1st Quarter**: 3

-   **Median**: 4

-   **3rd Quarter**: 5

-   **Maximum**: 5

```{r, echo=FALSE}
  print("five number summary (minimum, lower-hinge, median, upper-hinge, maximum):")
  print(fivenum(dog_data$Trainability))
```

# 3. Bivariate Analyses

### 3.1. Energy Level vs. Trainability

The scatter plot below displays the relationship between **Energy Level** and **Trainability**. An analysis

The scatter plot indicates a **positive correlation** between **Energy Level** and **Trainability**. As Energy Level increases, the average Trainability also tends to increase, suggesting that breeds with higher energy are often more trainable. The linear regression line further supports this trend, demonstrating a statistically significant relationship, which implies that selecting breeds with higher energy levels may lead to greater trainability. The **correlation coefficient** between Energy Level and Trainability was **0.383**, indicating a **slight positive relationship**.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dog_data_with_count_EL <- dog_data %>%
  group_by(Energy_Level, Trainability) %>%
  mutate(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(dog_data_with_count_EL, aes(x = Energy_Level, y = Trainability)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), color = "#333f48") +
  geom_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x', method = "lm", color = "#bf5700", show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Energy Level vs. Trainability",
       x = "Energy Level",
       y = "Trainability",
       size = "Frequency")

cor(dog_data$Energy_Level, dog_data$Trainability)
```

### 3.2. Openness to Strangers vs. Trainability

The boxplot below illustrates the relationship between **Openness to Strangers** and **Trainability**.

The scatter plot illustrates that breeds rated higher in **Openness to Strangers** tend to have greater **Trainability**. As Openness to Strangers increases, there is a noticeable increase in the average Trainability scores, suggesting that breeds which are more sociable and friendly are also more adaptable to training. A linear regression analysis confirms that this relationship is statistically significant, reinforcing the idea that sociability can influence trainability. The **correlation coefficient** between Openness to Strangers and Trainability was **0.329**, indicating a **slight positive relationship**.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dog_data_with_count_OtS <- dog_data %>%
  group_by(Openness_To_Strangers, Trainability) %>%
  mutate(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(dog_data_with_count_OtS, aes(x = Openness_To_Strangers, y = Trainability)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), color = "#333f48") +
  geom_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x', method = "lm", color = "#bf5700", show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Openness to Strangers vs. Trainability",
       x = "Openness to Strangers",
       y = "Trainability",
       size = "Frequency")

cor(dog_data$Openness_To_Strangers, dog_data$Trainability)
```

### 3.3. Coat Type vs. Trainability

The plot below illustrates the relationship between **Coat Type** and **Trainability**.

The analysis of Coat Type reveals that certain coat classifications are associated with varying levels of Trainability. The general trend seen is that breeds with smoother coats generally exhibit higher trainability compared to those with more complex coat types. Although this might seem like it suggests that physical characteristics like coat type may indeed play a role in a breed's adaptability and ease of training, it is likely that it a scenario when correlation is not equal to causation.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

dog_data_with_count_CT <- dog_data %>%
  group_by(Coat_Type, Trainability) %>%
  mutate(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(dog_data_with_count_CT, aes(x = Coat_Type, y = Trainability)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), color = "#333f48") +
  geom_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x', method = "lm", color = "#bf5700", show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Coat Type vs. Trainability",
       x = "Coat Type",
       y = "Trainability",
       size = "Frequency")
```

# 5. Conclusion

### 5.1. Findings

The scatter plots suggest a **positive correlation** between **Energy Level** and **Trainability**, indicating that breeds with higher energy levels tend to be more trainable. Similarly, the relationship between **Openness to Strangers** and **Trainability** also highlights a trend where more sociable breeds are likely to exhibit greater trainability. The analysis of **Coat Type**, however, does not seem to be very significant, as we observed variations in trainability across different coat classifications.

Overall, these findings suggest that **behavioral traits** significantly influence a breed's adaptability more than **physical characteristics**, which can be critical for potential dog owners in choosing a breed that fits their lifestyle.

### 5.2. Future Research

Future research could explore the impact of additional variables such as size, lifespan, or health predispositions on trainability. Expanding the dataset to include more diverse breeds and regional variations may also provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing trainability. Additional studies could be beneficial in assessing how training methods and environments are affected by the inherent traits of various breeds.
