## Set Working Directory

```{R}
setwd("~/Documents/UT/SDS 313/6 RMarkdown")
shelter <- read.csv("shelter.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
