## Questions

# 1.1. Scraping Data and Importing

```{r}
data <- as_tibble(read_csv("data.csv"))
```

# 1.2. Graph of the Distribution of 3 Pointers

```{r}
# Filter for the chosen teams
chosen_teams <- c("Indiana Fever", "Dallas Wings", "Los Angeles Sparks")
filtered_data <- data %>% filter(Team %in% chosen_teams)

# Create the distribution plot
ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = `3P`, fill = Team)) +  # Use backticks around `3P`
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of 3-Pointers Made by Players",
       x = "Number of 3-Pointers Made",
       y = "Number of Players") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Indiana Fever" = "red", "Dallas Wings" = "cyan", "Los Angeles Sparks" = "purple"))
```

# 1.3. Highlighting a Random Player

```{r}
random_player <- sample(data$Player, 1)
highlight_player <- data %>% filter(Player == random_player)

ggplot(data, aes(x = MP, y = TRB)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_point(data = highlight_player, aes(x = MP, y = TRB), color = 'navy') +
  geom_text(data = highlight_player, aes(label = Player), vjust = -1, color = "navy") +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Minutes Played and Total Rebounds",
       x = "Minutes Played",
       y = "Total Rebounds")
